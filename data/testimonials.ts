The venue were late moving tables so we had to delay the first song. Rich was so lovely and accommodating. Thanks so much to Rich, he was excellent!",

We've had so many people say to us what a great evening it was (no faint praise considering a lot of them were the 'Amsterdammers', many of whom appear to have PhDs in partying), you did an amazing job to keep the dance floor full throughout. All killer, no filler. All bangers, no clangers, as it were. Please do let us know if there is anywhere we can leave a testimonial so we can spread the word about how ace you are, any couple would be lucky to have you preside over their wedding dancefloor.",

So many people commented on how great you were and how good the music was and it really made the night so special so really thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Everyone loved Mark Anthony as well and that all went really smoothly and I think the stage worked really well generally as a podium for people to dance on afterwards! Anyway we thought you were awesome and everyone had such a great time, thanks once again for making the party and hope to see you at Babington some time.",
